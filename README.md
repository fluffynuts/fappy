Fast(-ish) Audio Playlist (generator) in Python

This is inspired by [fapg](http://royale.zerezo.com/fapg/), mainly because I wanted
an out-of-band playlist generator for windows and had already relied on fapg on Linux,
but there was no windows support at the time I wrote this (and I still can't find
windows binaries).

I'm quite sure FAPG is faster, but fappy _works everywhere there's python_, so that's
good enough for me (:
